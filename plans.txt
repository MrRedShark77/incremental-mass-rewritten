TO-DO LIST:
1: A new layer: Exotic
	1a. Axions: (WIP)
		Starting off with a grid of boosts, coming with upgrades on each side.
		Each upgrade gives levels to boosts, but increase the costs and have level limits.
		1a-i. Upgrades:
			Row Buildup: One upgrade gives levels to more boosts in a row, and wrap to next row.
			Link Upgrades: One gives levels to other Axion boosts.
			Cheapen Upgrades: A upgrade in a row cheapens other upgrades in a row.
			Turnback Upgrades: Levels cheapen upgrades.
	1b. Chroma Tree:
		A grid system which lines grow from things by iterating.
		There are 3 kinds of lines and 3 anti-kinds which iterate off from normal ones.
		These lines require iterations and cost things, and activate things on touch.
	1c. Quantum Foam:
		Connectable products?
	1d. Spectra Generators:
		You get Spectra Generators by fusing from Quantum Foam resources.
		Spectra Generators generate Chroma which is used to mix for both kinds from Chroma Tree.
		Spectra Generators boost stuff by upgrades, and boosted by Exotic Matter.
2: Another new layer: Strange
	2a. Blueprint:
		Coding with groups.
	2b. Primordium:
		???
	2c. ???:
		Mirror Mechanic?
3: Another Post-Strange layer or a new game?
	(Maybe called Hex, the High Ranked)
	(or Strange, the Strangely Matter?)
	(or Lightning / Cloudy)

B: Add a upgrade: No scalings to Tickspeed, except scales faster.
B2 (powerful upgrades):
1. All Tickspeed scalings start later based on mass.
2. All Rank scalings are weaker based on mass.
3. Hardened - Insane Challenge scalings are weaker based on mass.
4. Rank - Pent scale slower.
5. Dilated mass raises tickspeed.
6. 3rd Dilation Upgrade scales faster. (will be softcapped at ^0.96 exponent)
7. Axion Upgrades increase costs slower.
